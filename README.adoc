# RHV Infrastructure Playbooks

The Ansible playbooks have been created separately to allow the setup and creation of a RHV Environment (RHV 4.2 Tested).


The playbooks are based on a classroom environment that was intially created in Ravello. The playbooks can be easily modified by changing hostnames and inventory files to meet your specific environment requirement.

**NOTE**: The Utility server has already been setup and configured with IdM, NFS, and iSCSI. This will need to be considered if duplicating the environment.
